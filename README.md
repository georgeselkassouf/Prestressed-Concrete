# Description

The objective of this project is to analyze a 3-span continuous beam structure. This beam is subjected to a prestressing force and to external loads. 

# User Input

The user has the freedom to input one point load and/or one distributed load per span, the prestressing force, the equation of the prestressing tendon as well as the cross section's properties.

# Output

This tool will generate shear and moment diagrams for the three-span beam as well as top and bottom fibers stress diagrams.
